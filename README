This repository implemented three deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms (i.e., PPO, A2C, TRPO) to reconfigure power distribution systems to maximize load supply during disasters.

This repo uses the IEEE 34 test system as an environment to be used with the RL algorithms. The environment is obtained from the repo: https://github.com/Jubeyer/RL-to-Reconfigure-Microgrid. 

A few modifications are made. Specially, a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is added as a feature extractor. Comprehensive simulation cases are performed in both normal and post-disaster conditions. Additonally, A2C and TRPO algorithms are tested along with PPO. 

Detailed instructions for running the codes are added in two notebook, which are run_normal.ipynb and run_post_fault.ipynb to reconfigure the system during normal and post-disaster conditions, respectively.

Tensorboard is required to view the figures after the simulation.

As the OpenDSS software is supported on Windows PC, this repo requires windows PC to run. Python 3.8.10 is used for the simulation. The additional required python libraries are added as requirements.txt.
